> The home of me.txt, an open standard for personal LLM-friendly identity files

me.txt is a markdown file that lives at `yourdomain.com/me.txt` and provides AI systems with a concise, structured representation of a person — their identity, skills, current work, links, and collaboration preferences.

## Specification

The me.txt format mirrors the llms.txt spec:
- H1 with the person's name
- Optional blockquote with a one-line summary
- H2 sections: Now, Skills, Stack, Work, Writing, Talks, Links, Preferences
- Link lists using markdown syntax: `- [Title](url): Description`

## Key Sections

- `## Now`: Current projects and focus areas
- `## Skills`: Core competencies
- `## Links`: GitHub, Twitter, website, email
- `## Preferences`: Communication style, timezone, availability
