    When you talk to an AI assistant, it knows nothing about you. It can't see your GitHub, 
    doesn't know what you're working on, and has no idea how you prefer to communicate. 
    Every conversation starts from zero.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a problem that will only get worse. As AI becomes more integrated into our 
    workflows—writing emails, scheduling meetings, making introductions—it needs context 
    about who we are. Right now, that context is scattered across LinkedIn profiles, old 
    blog posts, GitHub readmes, and whatever fragments the AI can scrape together.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>There's no single, authoritative, LLM-optimized source of truth for a person.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Until now.
  </p>

  <h2>Meet me.txt</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="https://metxt.org">me.txt</a> is an open standard for personal identity files. 
    It's a simple markdown file that lives at the root of your personal website and tells 
    AI systems who you are.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're familiar with <a href="https://llmstxt.org">llms.txt</a>—the standard for 
    making websites AI-friendly—you already understand me.txt. Same format, same simplicity, 
    different subject: <em>you</em>.

- Response time: Within 24-48 hours
- Meetings: Only when async won't work`}</code></pre>

  <p>
    That's it. A markdown file. Human-readable, AI-native, self-authored.
  </p>

  <h2>The Preferences section</h2>

  <p>
    What makes me.txt different from a typical bio is the <code>## Preferences</code> section. 
    This is where you tell AI systems—and humans—<em>how</em> to interact with you:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Do you prefer async or sync communication?</li>
    <li>What timezone are you in?</li>
    <li>How quickly do you typically respond?</li>
    <li>What channels do you prefer (email, Slack, GitHub issues)?</li>
    <li>What kind of outreach are you open to—or not?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is especially powerful for AI-mediated introductions. When two people share their 
    me.txt files, an AI can instantly understand not just what they do, but how they might 
    work together effectively.
  </p>

  <h2>How to create yours</h2>

  <p>
    The fastest way to create a me.txt is with our CLI tool:
  </p>

  <pre><code>npx create-me-txt</code></pre>

  <p>
    This launches an interactive wizard that guides you through each field. When you're done, 
    it generates a valid me.txt file ready to publish.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can also pull data from your GitHub profile:
  </p>

  <pre><code>npx create-me-txt --github yourusername</code></pre>

  <p>
    This pre-populates your me.txt with your name, bio, top repos, and social links.
  </p>

  <h2>Where to put it</h2>

  <p>
    Place your me.txt at the root of your personal website:
  </p>

  <pre><code>https://yoursite.com/me.txt</code></pre>

  <p>
    Or if you prefer:
  </p>

  <pre><code>https://yoursite.com/.well-known/me.txt</code></pre>

  <p>
    That's it. No API keys, no sign-ups, no platform lock-in. It's just a file on your domain.
  </p>

  <h2>What's next</h2>

  <p>
    We're building out the me.txt ecosystem:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Directory</strong>: A browseable index of me.txt files across the web. 
      Submit yours at <a href="https://metxt.org/submit">metxt.org/submit</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Handshake</strong>: Paste two me.txt URLs and get an AI-generated collaboration 
      brief—showing how two people might work together based on their skills and preferences.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Integrations</strong>: VS Code/Cursor extensions, email tools, and more—all 
      using me.txt as the universal context layer.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Join the standard</h2>

  <p>
    me.txt is an <a href="https://github.com/me-txt/metxt.dev">open standard</a>, MIT-licensed, and 
    community-driven. The spec is simple by design—if you can write markdown, you can 
    create a me.txt.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Ready to create yours?</strong>
  </p>

  <pre><code>npx create-me-txt</code></pre>

  <p>
    Read the <a href="https://metxt.org/#spec">full specification</a>, browse the 
    <a href="https://metxt.org/directory">directory</a>, or follow 
    <a href="https://twitter.com/metxt">@metxt</a> for updates.
  </p>

  <p>
    The AI age needs a way for people to introduce themselves. That's me.txt.
